        # Backend API (if needed directly, e.g. for some assets or direct API calls)
        # But frontend proxies to backend usually via internal network. 
        # However, Gradio might need some direct access for websockets if not proxied by frontend?
        # The frontend uses Gradio Client which connects to backend.
        # If the client runs on the SERVER (in frontend container), it connects to http://backend:7860.
        # If the client runs in the BROWSER (not the case here, it's server-side rendering + SSE), 
        # then browser only talks to frontend.
        
        # So we only need to expose frontend.
